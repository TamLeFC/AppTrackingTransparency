# AppTrackingTransparency
Starting in iOS 14, IDFA will be unavailable until an app calls the App Tracking Transparency framework to present the app-tracking authorization request to the end user. If an app does not present this request, the IDFA will automatically be zeroed out which may lead to a significant loss in ad revenue.
